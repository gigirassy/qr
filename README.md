# QR

An extremely simple JS site hosted on GitHub Pages (or another static site host) that redirects to a site of your choosing after a few seconds. The site is meant to be linked via QR, and then you can put any link you'd like for the QR Code to redirect to.

Use the QR Code for:
1. A tattoo! (if you're confident the site will stay up for several decades; if not, get temporary ones.)
2. A patch on your clothing!
3. A shirt!
